# personal-portfolio

This is the repo for my personal website. The link is here: http://erick-dolores-website.s3-website.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.

The website is a platform through which I can talk about my experiences through an informal point of view. 
I offer all my social media links, learning experiences from internships, and personal interests on the site.
Feel free to use the site to get to know me better!:grinning:
